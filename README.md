# <h1 align="center" >My recently projects</h1>

I have built several Blockchain projects! My skills cover a wide range of features and functionalities, including minting, staking, evolution/breeding, raffle/auction houses, Launchpad, Marketplace, and P2E games such as dice, crash, jackpot, coinflip, and more. I look forward to learning more about the specific details of new skills.

    - As a beast, you will not only get 1:1 AD in that same series, but also be able to participate in various votings that will shape the future collections. The benefits do not stop there, as ofcourse more and more series mean more and more profits just by holding the NFT.
